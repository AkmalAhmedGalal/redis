Caching Database Queries
    - Implement a UserService that fetches users from a MySql database.
    - Use Redis to cache the user data so repeated queries return instantly.
    - Implement cache invalidation:
        -If a user updates their data, the cache should be updated/removed.
        -Expire the cache every 10 minutes.

API Rate Limiting with Redis
    -Implement an API endpoint: /api/messages/send.
    -Each user can only send 5 requests per minute.
    -If a user exceeds the limit, return an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.
    -Store the request count in Redis with a TTL of 1 minute.
